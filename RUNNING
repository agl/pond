Ensure that your environment is configured for running golang programs:

  export GOPATH=$HOME/go
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

Adjust these path locations to fit your Go environment.

Launch the GUI for Pond on GNU/Linux and similar operating systems:

  $GOPATH/bin/client

To run the Pond CLI:

  export PONDCLI=1
  $GOPATH/bin/client

These aliases may be useful:

  alias pond-client-cli="PONDCLI=1 $GOPATH/bin/client --state-file=/home/$USER/.pond"
  alias pond-client-gui="PONDCLI=0 $GOPATH/bin/client --state-file=/home/$USER/.pond"
