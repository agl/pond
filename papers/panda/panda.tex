\subsection*{Abstract}

We consider the problem of two parties seeking to establish secure
communications given {\it only} a shared secret.

Communication between two parties relies on in-band and out-of-band methods
when addressing identifiers change. We propose a system by which a pair or a
group of people or machines may derive new identifiers using only a password or
shared key. Thus we remove the requirement that any new communication must
occur before re-establishing entirely new identifiers.

\section{Introduction}

We propose a system by which a pair or a group of people or machines may derive
new identifiers using only a password or shared key; additionally, we propose
using this shared secret as the basis for re-authentication.

\subsection{The context of modern communication systems}
\label{sec:context}

Modern communication systems are designed with intentional flaws such as
CALEA\cite{CALEA} and with an adversaries that have budgets in the tens of
billions of US dollars\cite{NSABUDGET}. Adversaries such as the NSA
specifically attempt to sabatoge cryptographic projects\cite{BULLRUN} used in
the creation of secure communications systems. The current global
communications network allow for dragnet surveillance based on so-called {\it
selectors} and even world leaders\cite{MERKELPHONE} are not exempt from such
surveillance. Static identifiers such as telephone numbers, email addresses,
unique hardware identifiers and linkability across vast datasets the core of
selector based surveillance.

\subsection{The telephone re-numbering problem}
\label{renumber:telephone}

Telephone numbers change for various reasons. After a new number or a new
device with a new number is issued, a kind of discovery process is started
whereby the party may start to use the new number exclusively. It is also
possible that the old number will link to the new number or only release the
new number as it has superseded the original number.

Telephone numbers are generally not user selected but are rather issued by a
central authority; so called vanity numbers may be selected for a fee from
some operators.

The process of renumbering a telephone is generally solved in five different
ways. The first may come in the form of a message provided by the operator
that discloses the new number and disconnects the caller after an automated
message. The second is socially or through a publication of some kind;
generally when two people meet a new number may be disclosed or when a known
distribution point such as a news paper begins to print new numbers. The third
is through a party reading the caller information from their received call or
SMS list or by reviewing their bill. The fourth is through
misclosure\cite{kellycaine}, perhaps by a third party who may or may not be
authorized to disclose this information. The fifth is through a central listing
service of some kind, such as a phonebook, published by a network operator.

\subsection{The social nickname re-naming problem}
\label{rename:social-nickname}

People generally have full legal names and names by which they are known
socially. These full legal name mappings change through various legal means
that are out of scope. Nicknames are commonly held names that otherwise have
little or no legal status - when a party changes their nickname, they suffer
from the same issues faced by telephone renumbering\ref{renumber:telephone}.
Unlike telephone re-numbering, generally a person or group may pick any name
they choose as a new nickname. Such new nicknames may collide and cause
confusion though largely this may be irrelevant for a social group that has
other social identifiers.

\subsection{The nym renyming problem}

Electronic identities generally suffer from the same issues as telephone
renumbering\ref{renumber:telephone} and re-naming\ref{rename:social-nickname}
with the additional complexity of not having a central authority or out-of-band
communications methods by which to reconnect.

\subsection{The problem created by data loss}
\label{sec:problem}

Systems are often stolen or compromised in a way that results in total
dataloss for the user. In some cases the data may be compromised after a
variable window of time and in such a window, automatically changing
indentifiers may prevent full and on-going compromise of a pair-wise
communications channel.

\section{Gently Rockin' Zooko's Triangle}

Zooko's Triangle\cite{zookostriangle} is generalized as
having the choice between any two of the following three properties: secure,
decentralized and human-meaningful. In Pond\cite{pond}, the addressing system
properties are secure and decentralized. We propose that for a brief window of
time that users should have a way to change the chosen properties.  We assert
that trading the secure property for the human-meaningful property in the form
of phrases may be useful trade-off in a time limited, forward secret fashion.

Furthermore, we note that Zooko's Triangle is missing an important qualifier,
which is the passing of time and its relationship with each of the properties.

\section{Password authenticated key exchange}

We propose agreeing on a meeting point, such as an address or name of a
centralized HTTP server, or a decentralized key value store system.

Once we have established a meeting point, the two parties need to bootstrap
their shared secret into a cryptographic key exchange and a more efficient
method of communicating in the future. For example, the parties may wish to
exchange OpenPGP public keys and email addresses in a confidential and
authentic fashion. As a further example, Pond users may dynamically discover
peers with such a system.

This problem falls into the topic of Password Authenticated Key Exchange
(PAKE), which is a well studied problem. The first PAKE, EKE, was described by
Bellovin and Merritt\cite{bellovin1992encrypted} in 1992. However, we have one
additional requirement: that the protocol execute in a single round. We define
a round as a message sent by each party simultaneously, thus a message in a
given round cannot depend on any other message in the same round. We are
imposing this requirement as our meeting point may have very high latency and
we have no way of assigning the labels `client' and `server' to our parties.
Many PAKE protocols implicitly assume that the parties can behave differently
based on these labels (including the original EKE), but our parties have {\it
only} a shared secret. An exchange of messages could be used to break this
symmetry but the additional latency is undesirable.

The authors are most familiar with SPAKE2\cite{abdalla2005simple}, but SPAKE2
appears to be unsuitable because it masks Diffie-Hellman values with a mask
value raised to the power of the password and requires different mask values
for the two parties. Due to our symmetry requirement the two parties would have
to use the same value mask. We have proven that the CCDH problem from the SPAKE
paper is equally strong when the two mask values are equal, however the mask
values appear again in the security proof and it's not obvious to patch that
second hole.

\section{Key Exchange Details in practice with Pond}

We implemented the PANDA discovery technique for the Pond\cite{pond} messaging
system. We have chosen to use EKE2\cite{bellare2000authenticated}. EKE2 is very
similar to SPAKE2 but uses an ideal cipher to encrypt the Diffie-Hellman values
rather then masking them with secret group elements.

Our Diffie-Hellman group of choice is curve25519\cite{bernstein2006curve25519}
which results in a 255-bit Diffie-Hellman value, which is larger than the
128-bit block size of most ciphers. Using a typical block cipher mode would
result in an attacker having a discomforting amount of control of the resulting
plaintext. Using an AEAD mode would give an attacker an authenticator which
they could use to mount an offline, brute-force attack on the shared
secret\footnote{The attacker may already be able to mount an offline,
brute-force attack on the shared secret by using an identifier revealed to the
meeting point. But we still don't want to give them another avenue for this
attack in case a particular meeting point doesn't require that}. A wide-block
construction like LIONNESS\cite{anderson1996two} doesn't appear to be
applicable because the 256-bit block is too small to split into usefully sized
left and right parts for the Luby-Rackoff construction. Many other wide-block
constructions have proposed subsequently including
EME\cite{halevi2004parallelizable}, CMC\cite{halevi2004parallelizable},
XCB\cite{mcgrew2004extended}, HCTR\cite{wang2005hctr} and others. However, the
area is a patent minefield.

Instead we instantiate the ideal-cipher for EKE2 with a 256-bit block
Rijndael\cite{daemen2002design}. Although AES specified only a 128-bit block
size, Rijndael was originally specified with 128, 192 and 256-bit block sizes.
It's very uncommon to find an Rijndael implementation that implements a 256-bit
block size but since performance isn't a concern and nor are side-channels, a
custom, toy Rijndael implementation is sufficient.

The Pond key exchange between two users involves each creating a KeyExchange
protobuf\cite{pondprotobufs}. Since Pond servers demand a group signature
before accepting a message for delivery, there are no public Pond addresses
that can be used to bootstrap a Pond relationship. Rather we currently assume
an external, confidential and authentic means for users to exchange KeyExchange
messages.

A Pond KeyExchange message contains a group member private key (which is why
they need to be confidential), as well as the information needed to direct a
message to a user: their home server address and the user's public identity at
that server.  They also contain an Ed25519 key and the intent is that, in the
future, users will be able to update their home servers by sending messages to
each of their contacts. Group member revocations are also be signed by this
key.

Pond supports two methods of key exchange. The first is manual: the
KeyExchange messages are serialised with PEM and the user is expected to
exchange them with the intended contact, authentically and confidentially. For
example, a pre-existing relationship with PGP or OTR keys could be used to
bootstrap Pond.

The second method implemented\cite{panda} in Pond is the PANDA method. PANDA
allows a relationship to be established via a shared-secret. This works by
using a {\it meeting point} which, currently, involves contacting a
central HTTPS server over the Tor network. The shared secret is processed with
scrypt\cite{scrypt} into a key and two {\it meeting} IDs. The meeting point
simply acts as a pinboard where messages can be posted to a given meeting ID.
If a different message has already been posted to the same ID then it's
returned. The meeting point only allows two different messages to exist for a
given meeting ID until it's garbage collected (in about a week).

Instead Pond uses EKE2. EKE2 is very similar to SPAKE2 but uses an ideal cipher
to encrypt the Diffie-Hellman values rather than masking them with secret group
elements.

EKE2 is used to go from a shared-secret to an ephemeral, shared-key and then
the KeyExchange messages are encrypted with that key and exchanged via the
second meeting ID.

\subsection{Adding entropy to an easy to a human-meaningfully memoriable phrase}

The shared secret itself can consist of a passphrase, a time and a deck or two
of cards. Since humans are poor at generating and remembering secrets, a deck
of cards, shuffled and split in half serves quite well. Decks of cards are also
commonly available and don't have the downsides that bringing a mobile device
to a meeting might have.

Although the two halves of the deck are different, they are sufficient to
define a common, canonical set of cards. For Pond, the cards are ordered and
the canonical half is the one with the majority of the lowest numbered card. If
both halves have the same number of the lowest numbered card then the next
lowest is considered. If each half has exactly the same cards then both are
canonical.

A single deck of cards results in an approximately 49 bit shared secret and two
decks is 100 bits. The stacks of cards are a problem to dispose of (unlike a
memory, they can be obtained by dumpster diving) but they only need to be
protected until the key exchange is complete. After that they are no longer
sensitive.

\section{Conclusion}

Our design allows a pair or a group of people to discover or rediscover
each-other with knowledge of only a shared secret or human memorable
passphrase with optional entropy sources. Additionally, we believe that it
provides forward secrecy against attackers who wish to correlate names even
after a full client compromise.
