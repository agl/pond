title: Pond
---

<p>(<i>Note: recent events have lead to these topics being in the news quite often in recent weeks. However, Pond is not a reaction to those events - it was started nearly a year ago.</i>)</p>

<p>For secure, synchronous communication we have OTR and, when run over Tor, this is pretty good. But while we have secure asynchronous messaging in the form of PGP email, it's not forward secure and it gratuitously leaks traffic information. While a desire for forward secure PGP <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brown-pgp-pfs-03">is hardly new</a>, it still hasn't materialised in a widely usable manner.</p>

<p>Additionally, email is used predominately for insecure communications (mailing lists, etc) and is useful because it allows previously unconnected people to communicate as long as a (public) email address is known to one party. But the flip side to this is that volume and spam are driving people to use centralised email services. These provide such huge benefits to the majority of email communication, so it's unlikely that this trend is going to reverse. But, even with PGP, these services are trusted with hugely valuable traffic information if any party uses them.</p>

<p>So Pond is not email. Pond is forward secure, asynchronous messaging for the discerning. Pond messages are asynchronous, but are not a record; they expire automatically a week after they are received. Pond seeks to prevent leaking traffic information against everyone except a global passive attacker.</p>

<p><b>Dear God, please don't use Pond for anything real yet. I've hammered out nearly 20K lines of code that have never been reviewed. Unless you're looking to experiment you should go use something that <a href="http://gnupg.org/">actually works</a>.</b></p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>One can either build from source or use the prebuilt binaries. For building from source, see the section below.</p>

<p>The following binaries are all 64-bit and are distributed in signed, OpenPGP form. You can obtain my key with <tt>gpg --recv-key C92172384F387DBAED4D420165EB9636F02C5704</tt> or from <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/key.asc">https://www.imperialviolet.org/key.asc</a>.</p>

<h4>Building</h4>

<p>These are very simple build instructions that will get Pond running from source. You should read the commands before running them because, if nothing else, it'll put your GOPATH in <tt>~/gopkg</tt>, which may not be where you want.</p>

<h5>Ubuntu 13.10</h5>

<pre>sudo apt-get install golang git libgtk-3-dev libgtkspell3-3-dev libtspi-dev trousers tor mercurial
cd
mkdir gopkg
export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkg
go get github.com/agl/pond/client
$GOPATH/bin/client</pre>

<h5>Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu 12.04</h5>

<p>Same as Ubuntu, above, but 1) on the <tt>go get</tt> command line add <tt>-tags ubuntu</tt> before the URL and 2) the gtkspell package is called <tt>libgtkspell-3-dev</tt>. On more recent versions of Debian, the instructions should be exactly the same as Ubuntu.</p>

<h5>Tails</h5>
<p>Tails only supports the CLI mode of operation for Pond as it is based on an old Debian-stable.
Build, install and usage instructions for Tails users:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
sudo apt-get install -t unstable golang
sudo apt-get install mercurial trousers gcc
sudo apt-get install -t backports libtspi-dev
mkdir ~/Persistent/go/
export GOPATH=$HOME/Persistent/go/
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
go get -tags nogui github.com/agl/pond/client
alias pond-client="$GOPATH/bin/client --state-file=/home/amnesia/Persistent/.pond"</pre>

<h5>Fedora 19</h5>

<p>Fedora's <tt>golang</tt> package appears to be completely broken, so this installs Go from source.</p>

<pre>sudo yum install gtk3-devel gtkspell3-devel gcc trousers-devel git mercurial tor
sudo systemctl start tor
cd
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/go
cd go/src
./all.bash
cd
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
mkdir gopkg
export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkg
go get github.com/agl/pond/client
$GOPATH/bin/client</pre>

<h5>Arch</h5>
<pre>
yaourt -S trousers mercurial tor go
cd
mkdir gopkg
export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkg
go get github.com/agl/pond/client
systemctl start tor.service
$GOPATH/bin/client
</pre>

<p>In order to actually use the TPM, you'll need to <tt>systemctl start tcsd</tt>.</p>

<h5>OS X</h5>

<p>It's possible to get Pond building on OS X after spending <i>lots</i> of time with homebrew. Something that's known to have worked,</p>

<pre>
// you'll need an X server running in order to launch Pond unless you
brew edit gtk+3
// then add --enable-quartz-backend to the configure arguments
brew install go gtk+3 gtkspell3

export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkg
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

go get github.com/agl/pond/client
// now `client` should be in your path
</pre>

<p>However, unless you are already familiar with GTK development on OS X, I'd suggest using a Linux machine at this point. Since OS X development doesn't occur on my main development machine, I have to move patches across which also means that github doesn't always have the most up-to-date OS X changes.</p>

<p><i>WARNING</i>: there are no TPM chips in Macs and, since they generally use SSDs, which are log structured internally, messages cannot be safely erased. There is a firmware NVRAM on Macs that could be used for erasure storage, but I haven't written support for that yet.</p>
