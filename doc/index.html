title: Pond
---

<p>(<i>Note: recent events have lead to these topics being in the news quite often in recent weeks. However, Pond is not a reaction to those events - it was started nearly a year ago.</i>)</p>

<p>For secure, synchronous communication we have OTR and, when run over Tor, this is pretty good. But while we have secure asynchronous messaging in the form of PGP email, it's not forward secure and it gratuitously leaks traffic information. While a desire for forward secure PGP <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brown-pgp-pfs-03">is hardly new</a>, it still hasn't materialised in a widely usable manner.</p>

<p>Additionally, email is used predominately for insecure communications (mailing lists, etc) and is useful because it allows previously unconnected people to communicate as long as a (public) email address is known to one party. But the flip side to this is that volume and spam are driving people to use centralised email services. These provide such huge benefits to the majority of email communication, so it's unlikely that this trend is going to reverse. But, even with PGP, these services are trusted with hugely valuable traffic information if any party uses them.</p>

<p>So Pond is not email. Pond is forward secure, asynchronous messaging for the discerning. Pond messages are asynchronous, but are not a record; they expire automatically a week after they are received. Pond seeks to prevent leaking traffic information against everyone except a global passive attacker.</p>

<p><b>Dear God, please don't use Pond for anything real yet. I've hammered out nearly 20K lines of code that have never been reviewed. There are no binaries here for a good reason. Unless you're looking to experiment you should go use something that <a href="http://gnupg.org/">actually works</a>.</b></p>

<p>Please email any feedback to <tt>agl at imperialviolet dot org</tt> or else use GitHub's tools.</p>

<h4>Building</h4>

<p>These are very simple build instructions that will get Pond running from source. There are no binaries because that would suggest that it's reasonable for non-experts to be playing with Pond and that's not currently the case.</p>

<p>You should read the commands before running them because, if nothing else, it'll put your GOPATH in <tt>~/gopkg</tt>, which may not be where you want.</p>

<h5>Ubuntu 13.04</h5>

<p>Ubuntu only has Go 1.0, but that's sufficient (although future commits may accidently break compatibility because I develop with 1.1).</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install golang git libgtk-3-dev libgtkspell-3-dev libtspi-dev trousers tor mercurial
cd
mkdir gopkg
export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkg
go get github.com/agl/pond/client
go install github.com/agl/pond/client
$GOPATH/bin/client</pre>

<h5>Fedora 19</h5>

<p>Fedora's <tt>golang</tt> package appears to be completely broken, so this installs Go from source.</p>

<pre>sudo yum install gtk3-devel gtkspell3-devel gcc trousers-devel git mercurial tor
sudo systemctl start tor
cd
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/go
cd go/src
./all.bash
cd
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
mkdir gopkg
export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkg
go get -tags fedora github.com/agl/pond/client
go install github.com/agl/pond/client</pre>

<h5>Arch</h5>

<p>I don't have tested instructions for Arch, but one thing that will go wrong is that Arch's Trousers build enables a GTK-2 based UI. Pond uses GTK-3 and one cannot link GTK 2 and 3 into the same binary. You'll need the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=14330">trousers package from AUR</a> and you'll need to edit the <tt>PKGBUILD</tt> so that the <tt>configure</tt> command has <tt>--with-gui=openssl</tt>, not <tt>--with-gui=gtk</tt>. Then <tt>makepkg</tt> and <tt>pacman -U</tt> as normal. In order to actually use the TPM, you'll need to <tt>systemctl start tcsd</tt>.</p>

<h5>OS X</h5>

<p>It's possible to get Pond building on OS X after spending <i>lots</i> of time with homebrew. Something that's known to have worked,</p>

<pre>
  brew install go
  export GOPATH=$HOME/.go
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

  // you'll need an X server running in order to launch Pond unless you
  brew edit gtk+3
  // then add --enable-quartz-backend to the configure arguments
  brew install gtk+3

  // gtkspell3 from pull request
  brew install https://raw.github.com/arlolra/homebrew/5f52b19c79027dcea1d5e785b7ea70abd4ee90fe/Library/Formula/gtkspell3.rb
  ln -s /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/gtkspell3-3.0.pc /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/gtkspell-3.0.pc

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

  go get -tags fedora github.com/agl/pond/client
  go install github.com/agl/pond/client
  // now `client` should be in your path
</pre>

<p>However, unless you are already familiar with GTK development on OS X, I'd suggest using a Linux machine at this point.</p>

<p><i>WARNING</i>: there are no TPM chips in Macs and, since they generally use SSDs, which are log structured internally, messages cannot be safely erased. There is a firmware NVRAM on Macs that could be used for erasure storage, but I haven't written support for that yet.</p>
